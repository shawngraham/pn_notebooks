        "If we generate say 100 images an image generator like https://perchance.org/ai-text-to-image-generator and use the same prompt each time and we try the '[datafication of a kiss](https://www.cyberneticforests.com/news/how-to-read-an-ai-image)' approach[^1], what can we see? The idea is to treat the generated images as an infographic of the underlying dataset. What visual tropes or elements seem to be in play in the different clusters? What does that imply about the underlying data?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Go to Perchance and generate multiple images from the same prompt. use the same prompt 11 times. Take a screenshot of the grid of results each time. Rename your screenshots run1.png, run2.png, run3.png, run4.png, run5.png etc. Drag and drop the screenshots into the file tray here. Then, run the code below in **PART ONE** to slice each screenshot into its constituent sub images.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Then continue to **PART TWO**. Part two uses the PixPlot code from YaleDH. This code however was written for an _earlier_ version of Python, so we have to set up Colab to be able to use Python 3.7 _just_ for running Pixplot. This is what Part Two achieves. When you actually invoke pixplot against your folder of generated images, the code will drop each image through a trained neural network to turn it into a vector (a direction) within that model. Then it measures the similarity of each vector to every other, boiling that all down to a two dimensional plot where similar images occupy similar spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **PART THREE** is how we examine the results. When PixPlot ran, it created all of the pieces for a website that will show you the plot of image similarity as well as define hotspots (areas of similarity) and indexical images for those hotspots. It puts everything you need into a folder called 'output'. While it is possible to make this output website display within the notebook (which we'll try), that's not ideal. So the final thing you'll do is zip that output folder up and then use the Netlify Drop service https://app.netlify.com/drop to create a temporary website so you can explore your results.\n",
